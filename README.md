# Algorithmic Heights
This is my collection of Python codes used to solve the collection of exercises on [algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Sanjoy-Dasgupta/dp/0073523402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1502680767&sr=8-1&keywords=Dasgupta%2C+Papadimitriou%2C+and+Vazirani.) from the textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani. 

I checked my codes on the [Rosalind Bioinformatics website](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights "Rosalind").
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.
