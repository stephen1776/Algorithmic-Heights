# Algorithmic Heights
This is my collection of Python codes I wrote to solve the exercise problems from the textbook [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Sanjoy-Dasgupta/dp/0073523402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1502680767&sr=8-1&keywords=Dasgupta%2C+Papadimitriou%2C+and+Vazirani), by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.

I checked my codes on the [Rosalind Bioinformatics website](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights "Rosalind").
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) 'is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.'

___
###### 01 Fibonacci Numbers
Given: A positive integer n ≤ 25.

Return: The value of F<sub>n</sub>.

___
###### 02 Binary Search
The problem is to find a given set of keys in a given array.
___
###### 03 Degree Array
In an undirected graph, the degree d(u) of a vertex u is the number of neighbors u has, or equivalently, the number of edges incident upon it.

Given: A simple graph with n ≤ 10<sup>3</sup> vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.
___
###### 04 Insertion sort
This is a simple algorithm with quadratic running time that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

Given: A positive integer n≤10<sup>3</sup> and an array A[1..n] of integers.

Return: The number of swaps performed by insertion sort algorithm on A[1..n].
___
###### 05 Double-Degree Array
Given: A simple graph with n ≤ 10<sup>3</sup> vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the sum of the degrees of i's neighbors.
___
###### 06 Majority Element
An array A[1..n] is said to have a majority element if more than half of its entries are the same.

Given: A positive integer k ≤ 20, a positive integer n ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>, and k arrays of size n containing positive integers not exceeding 10<sup>5</sup>.

Return: For each array, output an element of this array occurring strictly more than n/2
times if such element exists, and "-1" otherwise.
